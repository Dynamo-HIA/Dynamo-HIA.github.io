To run Dynamo-HIA reference data is needed. Reference data from 2014 created as part of the DYNAMO-HIA project is available here. The data for the [Tutorial](tutorial) is also a good way to start.

#### Reference Dataset

A reference dataset is available containing reference data for all participating countries. For documentation on the data see the [documentation page](documentation).
